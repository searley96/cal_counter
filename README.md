## Calorie Counter

I wanted to create a project that would allow me to practice form validation. This project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I did a bit of UX research to determine which colors leave us with energizing feelings. I found that warm colors, those of sunsets, fall leaves, and fire are generally thought to reflect passion, positive energy, happiness, and enthusiasm. I wanted this project to stimulate these feelings in order to boost motivation in the user.
