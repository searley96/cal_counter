# SnackTracker: A Calorie Counter

I wanted to create a project that would allow me to practice form validation. This project was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows the user to easily calculate whether they have had a calorie surplus or deficit for the day. The user can enter in their daily calorie intake goal, the calories they consumed that day, as well as any exercise they've done that day, and click the 'Calculate Remaining Calories' button to see how many calories they have consumed/burned off that day. 

I did a bit of UX research to determine which colors leave us with energizing feelings. I found that warm colors, those of sunsets, fall leaves, and fire are generally thought to reflect passion, positive energy, happiness, and enthusiasm. I wanted this project to stimulate these feelings in order to boost motivation in the user.
